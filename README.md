# BBC Website Design

I am taking a course at Udemy on Web Development called "The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0".

In this course we create a mockup of BBC's Technology page. 

This is my version of it - I followed the videos but made a lot of changes of my own to make it look closer to the current page (at the time I created it) instead of copying the teacher's current page.
